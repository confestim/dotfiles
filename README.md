## Dotfiles
I decided to be like the cool kids and publish my dot files on github. Enjoy.

### init.vim
My config for neovim. Amalgamation of a couple of tutorials and existing rices.

### zshrc
My config for zshell. I use oh-my-zsh for the plugins and themes. It is mostly just aliases and p10k (dracula) theme.

### qtile.py
My config for the qtile WM (mostly non-riced arco linux theme). I use sxhkd for program launching keybindings.

> [!NOTE]
> I don't use this WM anymore, I use hyprland (with a slightly riced [ML4W](https://www.ml4w.com/) theme) and Gnome with [Tiling Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7065/tiling-shell/)


### kitty.conf
My config for the kitty terminal emulator. I use the default dracula theme.

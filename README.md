## Dotfiles
I decided to be like the cool kids and publish my dot files on github. Enjoy.

### init.vim
My config for neovim.

### zshrc
My config for zshell.

### qtile.py
My config for the qtile WM. Rename Qtile_Assets to Assets and put it in the qtile config folder. Bar stolen from [this repo](https://github.com/Darkkal44/CozyTile/).
